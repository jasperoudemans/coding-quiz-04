## description of application
This is an attempt at a quiz powered by JavaScript. My approach to the problem was to create a structure of JavaScript objects which store the 
question, the options to choose from, and the index of the correct question. I made a start button that starts the timer and displays the first 
question and set of options. I got the questions, options, and correct answer button all to change after each click of a selection and the score
of the player is dynamically generated and increments by 100 points per correct answer. I did not manage to create a time penalty for wrong 
answers nor to store scores in local storage.
